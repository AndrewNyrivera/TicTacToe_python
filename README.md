# **Tic Tac Toe Game**

### **Why?**
I created this Tic Tac Toe Game to really push my understanding of functions, and logical operators.
This basic Tic Tac Toe Game has really pushed my understanding of how recursion works, and how to iterate through objects properly.
This was alot of fun and felt like I did a good job for my first attempt 

#### **Want to play?**
If you would want to play this Tic Tac Toe game you can clone it from my repository and you just need to run it in your command prompt for windows users, terminal for Mac users, or if you have a code editior you can run it through there. Just make sure you have the latest version of python installed. Enjoy!
